# RushHour
This is a Java course project which required us to implement a casual game called RushHour to get us familiar with Swing GUI programming. I found a lot of fun developing this game and keep updating it even the course already finished (of course I got an A-rank in that term). 

In this game, your are in a busy traffic and need to move out cars in other lanes to get your car (the red one) out of the traffic jam. If you are a Chinese, you may find it's somehow like a simpler version of Huarong Dao, a famous sliding block puzzle game (I heard that such kind of games are called Klotski, but I'm not sure about it). You can also find the description of this game on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(board_game)) or you can just [play it online](http://www.thinkfun.com/play-online/rush-hour/).
